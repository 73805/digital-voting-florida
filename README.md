## Florida Voting Shifts and the presence of Digital Voting Technology
This mini project graphs Florida's presidential voting shift for the 2016 Presidential election. Points represent counties, and are color coded by the presence (or absence) of digital voting systems. Orange for present, green for absent.

## Background information

With Russia directly interfering with the US elections in the form of email hacks/dumps and probing of voter registeries, there was a valid concern with direct vote manipulations. The graph produced here does not appear to show a correlation between the presence of digital voting machines and substantial increases in votes for the republican candidate between 2012 and 2016. There are a multitude of confounding variables. This project was mainly an exercise is gathering, formatting, and visualizing data.
